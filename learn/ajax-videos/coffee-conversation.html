    <h1>Coffee & Conversation - Stories of Homelessness </h1>

    <p>Coffee & Conversation is a photo/video/art project that aims to end the stigma of homelessness in Brattleboro, VT. To treat people as people, with respect and dignity. Instead of passing by a homeless person and ignoring them, to actually meet their eyes and ask how they are or even engage in conversation. Being homeless is a lonely, isolating place and sometimes even the smallest interaction can make all the difference.</p>

    <p>Many people do not know how to approach someone who is homeless and the homeless have a difficult time approaching someone who is not homeless. Fear is on both sides of this situation. This project will take that fear away, create community connections and participation and acceptance.

    Coffee & Conversation is laying the ground work for change in Brattleboro, VT. An exhibit is planned for December 2015 at the River Garden, 157 Main Street in Brattleboro. We are also hosting several 'coffee hours' and will have a 'homeless for the holidays' donation box at the exhibit.
