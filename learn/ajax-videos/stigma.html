    <h1>Stigma and Stereotypes</h1>

    <p>We want people to understand that not all homeless people are the same and that each person is an individual in their own way. They each have their own story. 

    Instead of putting on blinders when walking past a homeless person, we want to start off with the small things. Take a minute or two out of your day to have a simple conversation with a homeless person and learn their story. A little bit goes a long way when you need it the most.</p>
